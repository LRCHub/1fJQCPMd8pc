# Anonymouz – River

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Water running,
Stronger,
rougher,
holding onto (any-any) anything
All I want is to survive it
If I let go, will it be the end of me?
Got to move on,
Held on too long,
Sweep me away,
Right into the ocean
Mighty river release my soul, I need to see the
world
To the unknown, I’ll go against my sorrow
（Sorrow）
Mighty river release my soul out to the open
gold
I can stay here forever in this hollow（Hollow）
Oh, river take me out
Take me away river
Oh, river take me out
Take me out into the unknown
Oh, river take me out
Take me away river
Oh, river take me out
Take me out into the unknown （Out into the
unknown）
Oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh, oh
Whoah-oh, oh
Out into the ocean
